# ISS-Code
Code used to analyse data from the [ISOLDE Solenoidal Spectrometer](https://isolde-solenoidal-spectrometer.web.cern.ch/). A number of different codes used here:

### AlphaCalibration
Performs an alpha calibration on the data that you feed in. Used a quadruple alpha source, so selects for those peaks (pre-defined positions as working with a small data set), and then fits a series of Gaussian peaks for extracting centroids and doing an energy calibration.

### Doublet

### ELUMSolidAngle

### ELUMYield

### Plotter

### analyse-tree

### array-geometry

### cm-angle-calculator

### energy-calibration

### fit-background-yields

### super-unbound-fit

### unbound-doublet-fit
